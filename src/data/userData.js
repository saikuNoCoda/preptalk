Before joining this I know the things which is asked in interview but I don't know how to explain the things after joining this I give a session after that  they pick my error in how I give interview like first approach Brut Force approach then optimize approach and pick standard words for explaining the things like if we want to use count of a number then use word hashing etc. After giving all these mock interview I understand my mistake and work on it and I finally placed in Amdocs. Thank you ðŸ˜Š",

It also helps me to improve my problem solving skills we had an in depth discussion on my projects and resume, which gave me an idea of the kind of questions which can be asked in a real interview.
