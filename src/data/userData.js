Before joining this I know the things which is asked in interview but I don't know how to explain the things after joining this I give a session after that  they pick my error in how I give interview like first approach Brut Force approach then optimize approach and pick standard words for explaining the things like if we want to use count of a number then use word hashing etc. After giving all these mock interview I understand my mistake and work on it and I finally placed in Amdocs. Thank you ðŸ˜Š",
